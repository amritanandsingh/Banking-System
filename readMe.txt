                Banking System - README
=============================================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project involves the development of a banking system using C++. The system stores data in CSV format and utilizes Linkedlist for efficient CRUD operations on customer accounts and data.

Key Features:
--------------
- Create and manage customer accounts.
- Perform various banking transactions.
- Data is stored in CSV format for persistence.

Data Management:
-----------------
The system reads and loads data from CSV files, ensuring that customer information is stored securely and can be retrieved easily.

CRUD Operations:
-----------------
The system supports comprehensive CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on customer accounts and associated data.

Advanced C++ Concepts:
-----------------------
The project showcases the use of advanced C++ concepts:
- Implementation of the Factory Design Pattern for flexible object creation.
- Utilization of virtual destructors and pure virtual functions to achieve polymorphism and inheritance.

SOLID Principles:
------------------
The project adheres to SOLID principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each module has a distinct purpose.
- Open/Closed: Code is extendable without modifying existing code.
- Liskov Substitution: Derived classes can replace base classes seamlessly.
- Interface Segregation: Interfaces are client-specific to prevent unnecessary dependencies.
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.

Operator Overloading:
----------------------
Operator overloading enhances the usability of classes, making interactions more intuitive.

Exception Handling:
--------------------
Robust exception handling ensures smooth execution even in unexpected scenarios.

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
1. Compile and build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate the banking system.
3. Perform various operations like creating accounts, making transactions, and updating customer data.

Code Structure:
----------------
The codebase is organized into well-defined modules and classes, promoting maintainability and clarity.

Future Improvements:
---------------------
Potential enhancements include:
- Implementation of additional transaction types.
- Integration with online banking services.
- Enhanced user interface for better user experience.
